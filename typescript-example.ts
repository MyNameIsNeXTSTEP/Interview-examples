// How can we refactor it and make simpler to read and understand, keeping immutability and all the logic inside ?
// What we need:
// 1. Rules must be provided with comments somehow
// 2. When we add something it always is about new object
// 3. If rules are not marked with ids - its error
// 4. Somehow rules must be marked with ids
